introduction
NativeUI and NativeUIReloaded are almost the same with some small Feature and Performance  Differences i would advise you use NativeUIReloaded if possible but both work almost  the same code wise (except the fxmanifest)
to use NativeUI or NativeUI Reloaded (im gonna refer both to NativeUI) u firstly need to download them, 
its very very important to not rename them, because they use direct paths to their files!  they wont work otherwise
