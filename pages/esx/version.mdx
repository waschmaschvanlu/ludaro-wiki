Certainly! Here's a documentation on how to check the ESX version you have, along with the appropriate steps for different versions, in Markdown format:

# ESX Version Checking and Documentation

ESX is a popular framework for creating custom game modifications (mods) for FiveM servers. It provides a range of features and functionalities to enhance gameplay and create immersive experiences. This documentation will guide you through the process of checking your ESX version and understanding the differences between various versions.

## Checking Your ESX Version

To determine your ESX version, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to your FiveM server's resources folder.
2. Look for the following folders:
   - "essentialmode"
   - "es_extended"

By identifying the presence of these folders, you can determine your ESX version.

## ESX 1.1 (Very Old)

If you have a folder named "essentialmode," you are using ESX version 1.1. This version is considered very old and dates back about six years as of the time of writing. While it may have served its purpose in the past, it's recommended to consider updating to a newer version due to potential security risks and the availability of more advanced features in later ESX releases.

## ESX Versions Above 1.2

If you have a folder named "es_extended," you are using an ESX version above 1.2. To find your current version:

1. Open the file `es_extended/fxmanifest.lua` using a text editor.
2. Look for the `version` field within the file.

The `version` field will indicate your current ESX version.

## ESX Beta Version (Between EssentialMode and ESX)

If you have both the "essentialmode" and "es_extended" folders present, you are likely using a beta version that falls between the transition from EssentialMode to ESX. Just like with the "essentialmode" folder alone, it's recommended to update to a more recent and stable version of ESX.

## Conclusion

Determining your ESX version is crucial for maintaining the security and functionality of your FiveM server. Outdated versions may pose security risks and lack access to newer features and improvements.

Keep in mind that ESX has evolved significantly over time, offering enhanced performance, stability, and a wider array of customization options. Staying up-to-date with the latest version will ensure you're benefiting from these improvements while providing a secure and enjoyable gaming experience for your players.
